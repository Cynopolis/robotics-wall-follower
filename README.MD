This library is meant to create a robot which can follow another robot. It uses an ESP32 for GPIO and a raspberry pi for computer vision. These two devices are linked using serial.

To install all of the python packages required, use the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The code that is meant to run on the ESP32 is stored in Arduino-IO.
The code that is meant to run on the Raspberry Pi is stored in Minibot.
